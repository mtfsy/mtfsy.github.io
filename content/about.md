## üìÑ Summary
I am sofware enginner, work mainly on cloud, infra, linux, system, service, and service. My skill foccused on leveraging automation, scale, and optimization to solve problem in the industry. My main tools are container (Docker, Podman, Containerd) technology, Bash, Python, Go, and of course google search. I am interested in distributed computing and software engineering topic, hit me on email if you are interested as well. I am also love open source project and contributing as often as i can possible.

<!---
I am a versatile and experienced Software Engineer dedicated to improving software delivery and optimization. My professional journey has taken me through the consulting, mining, and high-growth startup sectors, giving me a unique and adaptable skill set. My expertise covers the full spectrum of the development lifecycle, from designing and implementing robust CI/CD pipelines with tools like GitHub Actions and Jenkins to managing and securing diverse infrastructure across on-premises environments and major cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure. I am highly proficient in establishing comprehensive observability with tools such as Datadog, Azure Monitor, and Google Cloud Logging, while also leveraging automation with Terraform and Ansible. I have extensive experience with various databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and BigQuery, and I am skilled in crucial security measures like network hardening and incident response using Microsoft Sentinel. Finally, I am focused on building efficient and scalable Internal Developer Platforms using Docker and Kubernetes, with a special focus on managing these platforms on GKE and AKS.
